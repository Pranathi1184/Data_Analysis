# ⚡ Energy Efficiency Analytics Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes **building energy performance** and predicts **heating and cooling loads** using Python and Power BI.  
The dashboard visualizes model performance, energy metrics, and key features influencing efficiency.

---

## 🧠 Business Objective
To identify how architectural features (roof area, wall area, glazing, height, etc.) impact building energy efficiency,  
and to develop regression models for **Heating Load** and **Cooling Load** prediction.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI (Data Visualization, DAX, Dashboard Design)
- Linear Regression for predictive modeling

---

## 🧮 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration** – Removing nulls, renaming columns, exploring correlations  
2. **Model Building** – Multiple Linear Regression for heating and cooling loads  
3. **Performance Evaluation** – Metrics: R², RMSE  
4. **Visualization in Power BI** – Actual vs Predicted charts, feature importance bars  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- Heating Load R² ≈ **0.79**
- Cooling Load R² ≈ **0.76**
- Features like **Overall Height** and **Wall Area** were most influential  
- Power BI visuals: scatter plots, trend lines, feature bars
