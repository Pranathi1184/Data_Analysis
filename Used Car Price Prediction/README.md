# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction — Machine Learning Project

## 📘 Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict **used car prices** based on factors like brand, mileage, age, and transmission type.

---

## 🧠 Business Objective
To help used car dealers and buyers estimate fair prices for used vehicles by identifying key price-driving attributes.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Random Forest Regression
- Power BI / Tableau for visualization

---

## 🧮 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Outlier Removal  
2. Feature Engineering (Car Age, Encoded Categorical Variables)  
3. Model Training — Random Forest Regressor  
4. Evaluation — R² and RMSE metrics  
5. Visualization — Feature Importance, Actual vs Predicted  

---

## 📊 Results
- **R² Score:** ~0.90  
- **RMSE:** ~$3,000–$5,000  
- **Top Predictors:** Car Age, Odometer, Manufacturer, Transmission
